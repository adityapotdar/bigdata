1. Store raw data into hdfs location
hadoop fs -put /home/cloudera/data/sales_order_data.csv /assignment

2. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table
create table sales_order_csv
    > (
    > ORDERNUMBER int,
    > QUANTITYORDERED int,
    > PRICEEACH float,
    > ORDERLINENUMBER int,
    > SALES float,
    > STATUS string,
    > QTR_ID int,
    > MONTH_ID int,
    > YEAR_ID int,
    > PRODUCTLINE string,
    > MSRP int,
    > PRODUCTCODE string,
    > PHONE string,
    > CITY string,
    > STATE string,
    > POSTALCODE string,
    > COUNTRY string,
    > TERRITORY string,
    > CONTACTLASTNAME string,
    > CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
    > DEALSIZE string
    > )
    > row format delimited
    > fields terminated by ","
    > tblproperties("skip.header.line.count" = "1");
    
3. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 
load data inpath "/assignment/sales_order_data.csv" into table sales_order_csv;

4. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"
> create table sales_order_orc
    > (
    > ORDERNUMBER int,
    > QUANTITYORDERED int,
    > PRICEEACH float,
    > ORDERLINENUMBER int,
    > SALES float,
    > STATUS string,
    > QTR_ID int,
    > MONTH_ID int,
    > YEAR_ID int,
    > PRODUCTLINE string,
    > MSRP int,
    > PRODUCTCODE string,
    > PHONE string,
    > CITY string,
    > STATE string,
    > POSTALCODE string,
    > COUNTRY string,
    > TERRITORY string,
    > CONTACTLASTNAME string,
    > CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
    > DEALSIZE string
    > )
    > stored as orc;

5. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"
insert overwrite table sales_order_orc select * from sales_order_csv;


a. Calculatye total sales per year
select year_id, sum(sales) as total_sales from sales_order_orc group by year_id;

b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
select productline, count(ordernumber) as total_orders from sales_order_orc group by productline limit 1;

c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
select qtr_id, sum(sales) as total_sales from sales_order_orc group by qtr_id;

d. In which quarter sales was minimum
select qtr_id, sum(sales) as total_sales from sales_order_orc group by qtr_id order by total_sales limit 1;

e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
Maximum Sales - select country, sum(sales) as total_sales from sales_order_orc group by country order by total_sales desc limit 1;
Minimum Sales - select country, sum(sales) as total_sales from sales_order_orc group by country order by total_sales limit 1;

f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
select city, qtr_id, sum(sales) as total_sales from sales_order_orc group by city, qtr_id;

h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold
